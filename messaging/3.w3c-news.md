FOR REVIEW: Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements First Public Draft Note

The Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Research Questions Task Force (RQTF) welcomes feedback on the first public Draft Note of the [Collaboration Tool Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/).


The purpose of this document is to outline various accessibility-related user needs, requirements and scenarios for collaboration tools.



Functions of collaborative tools include real-time editing of content by multiple authors, the use of comments or annotations, and revision control. Examples of collaborative tools include a Web-based text editor or word processor offering these functions.



The accessibility-related user needs and corresponding requirements may be implemented in the collaboration tool itself, or elsewhere, for example in an assistive technology such as a screen reader.



The solutions identified in this document are intended to influence the
evolution of future accessibility guidelines, technical
specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive
technologies. They are relevant to software developers who
contribute to any of these aspects of the collaborative experience
