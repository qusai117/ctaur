Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on the First Public Working Draft of: Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements.

Overview

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, collaborative, content creation and editing applications. These facilities include real-time co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments. Modern, Web-based word processors provide typical examples of such features, but the scope of this document is broader, encompassing a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments. The accessibility-related issues raised by these capabilities are not directly addressed elsewhere in W3C’s guidance.

In-progress updates to the document are available in the Editors’ Draft at: https://w3c.github.io/ctaur/

For review

Comments on all aspects of the document are of interest. However, it would be particularly useful at this stage to identify user needs and issues that have not been addressed in this early draft. Much of the related research literature focuses on the needs of screen reader users, and this emphasis is currently reflected in the document. The Learning and Cognitive Disabilities Accessibility Task Force is compiling comments in parallel with the public review. Broad review from a cross-disability perspective is encouraged.

Comments

To comment, please open a new issue in the Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements GitHub repository: https://github.com/w3c/ctaur/issues/new. Please create separate GitHub issues for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue.

If it’s not feasible for you to use GitHub, send comments in e-mail to: public-rqtf@w3.org. Please:
* put your comments in the body of the message, not as an attachment
* start your e-mail subject line with: [CTAUR]

Please send comments by Friday 30 December 2022.
