Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on a Wide Review Draft of:
      *Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements*
      https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/

In-progress updates to the document are available in the Editors’ Draft at:
      https://w3c.github.io/ctaur/

Overview:

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, collaborative content creation and editing applications. This includes real-time co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments. Modern web-based word processors provide examples of such features. The scope of this document is broader; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments.

Seeking input:

We encourage broad review from a cross-disability perspective. This Wide Review draft incorporates substantial revisions made in response to comments on the First Public Working Draft by the *Learning and Cognitive Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force* [1]. These changes  include the addition of requirements as well as clarification of the document's scope. Review of the revised draft is encouraged, as are comments identifying accessibility issues within the scope of the document that are not addressed in the current text.
