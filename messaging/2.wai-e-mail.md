_Subject:_ **For Review: Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements - First Draft**

plain text!:
<pre>
Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on the First Public Working Draft of:
      *Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements*
      https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/

In-progress updates to the document are available in the Editorsâ€™ Draft at:
      https://w3c.github.io/ctaur/

Overview:

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, collaborative content creation and editing applications. This includes real-time co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments. Modern web-based word processors provide examples of such features. The scope of this document is broader; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments.

Seeking input:

We encourage broad review from a cross-disability perspective. We particularly invite input on additional user needs and issues that are not addressed in this early draft. Much of the relevant research literature is on the needs of screen reader users, and the current draft document has this emphasis. We look forward to incorporating additional input, including on the needs of users with cognitive and learning disabilities. (If you are interested in contributing in this area, please consider working with W3C Cognitive Accessibility Community Group or Task Force.[1])
