_Subject:_ **For Wide Review: Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements - Revised Working Draft**

<pre>
Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on a Wide Review Draft of:
      *Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements* (CTAUR)
      https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/

Overview:

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, real-time or asynchronous collaborative content creation and editing applications. This includes co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments. Modern web-based word processors provide such features. However, the scope of CTAUR is broader; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments in our attempt to comprehensively address accessibility in collaborative editing technologies.

Seeking input:

We encourage broad review from a cross-disability perspective. This Wide Review draft incorporates substantial revisions made in response to comments on the First Public (and subsequent) Working Drafts by various stakeholders, including especially the *Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force* [1]. These comments led to   the addition of significant requirements as well as to clarification of the document's scope. We especially request comments on the following four questions:

1.  We came to understand the collaborative editing environment in terms of managing complexity. We observed that many word processing, spread sheet, software development, and media development environments are themselves intrinsically complex. To this, collaborative tooling adds a further layer of complexity, namely the management of proposed, accepted, and rejected edits from multiple participants. Does this framing make sense? Is its import clearly communicated by the document?

2.  Do we delineate between the content creation elements of software and those relating to managing collaboration sufficiently? Is the distinction meaningfully communicated? Do you agree with this scoping?

3.  We inserted a section in our Introduction on Social Considerations for the first time in any of our publications. This brief section is included to communicate which stakeholders we regard responsible for which aspects of collaborative efforts. Is this helpful?

4.  We created a glossary to define the term "WYSIWYG" in response to a comment.  Are there other terms we use you would like defined in our glossary?
