      <p>This document outlines various accessibility-related user needs, requirements and scenarios for collaboration tools. The tools of interest are distinguished by their support for one or more specific collaborative features. These features include real-time editing of content by multiple authors, the use of comments or annotations, and revision tracking. A Web-based text editor or word processor offering all of these features would be a central example of such a collaboration tool.</p>
      <p>The accessibility-related user needs and corresponding requirements described in this document may be implemented in the collaboration tool itself, or elsewhere, for example in in an assistive technology such as a screen reader. The scope of the discussion is not limited to problems that can be solved in the design or implementation of the collaboration tool. Instead, a holistic approach is taken that gives foremost priority to the user's perspective, leading to the identification of solutions that may be implemented by different components of the software involved in performing a collaborative task.</p>
      <p>Although the user needs and associated requirements identified in this document <em>are not normative accessibility guidance</em>, they may influence the evolution of future accessibility guidelines, technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to any of these aspects of the collaborative experience.</p>

        <h3>What are Collaboration Tools?</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of this document, a <em>collaboration tool</em> is any software that supports features designed to facilitate the interactive creation, editing or annotation of content by multiple contributors. Examples of collaboration tools include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Web-based text editor or word processor that enables multiple authors to edit content simultaneously, with each contributor's changes being integrated into the resulting text and propagated in real time to the collaborators.</li>
          <li>A tool that enables Web pages to be annotated with comments that are automatically made available to other users of the annotation service who access the same pages with suitable software. The software may be included in a user agent, or it may be supplied as an extension.</li>
        </ul>
