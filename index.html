      <p>This document outlines various accessibility-related user needs, requirements and scenarios for web-based collaboration tools. These typically include one or more specific collaborative features such as real-time content editing by multiple authors, support for comments annotations, and revision control. The Cloud-based office application suites from Google and Microsoft are well-known examples of such collaboration tools.</p>
      <p>The accessibility user needs and requirements described in this document may be implemented in the collaboration tool itself, or in an assistive technology application such as a screen reader or screen magnifier. We take a holistic approach to give foremost priority to the user&apos;s perspective, leading to the identification of solutions that may be implemented by different components of the software involved in performing a collaborative task.</p>
      <p>Although the user needs and requirements identified in this document <em>are non-normative</em>, they may influence the development of future accessibility guidelines, normative technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to the collaborative experience.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="collaboration-tools">
        <h3>What are collaboration tools?</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this document, a <dfn>collaboration tool</dfn> is any software that supports features designed to facilitate the interactive creation, editing or annotation of content by multiple contributors, whether working in simultaneous collaboration or asynchronously. Examples of collaboration tools include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Web-based text editor or word processor that enables multiple authors to edit content simultaneously, with each contributor's changes being integrated into the resulting text and propagated in real time to the collaborators.</li>
          <li>A tool that enables Web pages to be annotated with comments that are automatically made available to other users of the annotation service who access the same pages with suitable software. The software may be included in a user agent, or it may be supplied as an extension.</li>
          <li>An Integrated Development Environment (<abbr title="Integrated development Environment">IDE</abbr>) that supports the collaborative editing of program source code in real time.</li>
          <li>A wiki that supports version control, for example by enabling authors to revert to prior versions of a page or to view the differences between two versions.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="distinctive-features">
        <h3>Distinctive features of collaboration tools</h3>
        <p>This document focuses primarily on features unique to collaboration tools, rather than features which they share with other Web applications or with application software in general. Indeed, any tool that provides one or more of the features enumerated here may benefit from the user needs and corresponding requirements elaborated in the sections that follow.</p>
        <p>The distinctive capabilities of collaboration tools are illustrated by the examples in section<a href="#collaboration-tools"></a>. It is important to consider how these features are manifested in the tool&apos;s user interface. From this perspective, the distinguishing features may be described as follows.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Real-time co-editing</dt>
          <dd>A feature enabling multiple authors to edit the same content simultaneously. The changes introduced by different authors are combined in real time, using algorithms such as operational transformation [[concurrency-control]]. The combined changes are then made immediately visible in all of the participating authors' editing sessions. The effect is that each author can perceive, in real time, the changes made by collaborators, including the location of another author's focus within the content.</dd>
          <dt>Annotation of content with comments</dt>
          <dd>Some tools enable users to associate comments with parts of the content that is being read or edited. In systems such as word processors, replying to comments is supported, allowing threads of discussion to be associated with parts of a document.</dd>
          <dt>Comparing revisions</dt>
          <dd>Some systems can display the differences between revisions of a text for purposes of comparison.</dd>
          <dt>Suggested changes</dt>
          <dd>Some word processors can show changes (insertions, deletions and formatting-related modifications) made by collaborators, which an author can choose to accept or reject. These revisions are sometimes referred to as <dfn>suggested changes</dfn> or as <dfn>tracked changes</dfn>. Each change may be accompanied by metadata, for example the identity of the author who made the change, and a time stamp.</dd>
          <dt>Access controls</dt>
          <dd>Some collaborative environments support <em>access controls</em>, allowing restrictions to be imposed on modification of part or all of the content. Permission to modify content may be granted on a granular basis to specific individuals or to groups of users. For example, in a collaborative tool for creating fillable forms, some users may only be allowed to change the values of input fields (i.e., to complete a form), whereas others may be free to edit any aspect of the document, including the addition, deletion and rearrangement of form fields.</dd>
	</dl>

          <p>Collaboration tools differ widely in the nature of content that may be edited. They also differ widely in the user interfaces presented to users. For example, word processors typically provide a <q>what you see is what you get</q> (<abbr title="what you see is what you get">wysiwyg</abbr>) interface based on a rendered view of the content, whereas editors designed for use with source code or markup language text do not. In the latter case, indentation and syntax highlighting may be the only visual cues to the structure of the code or markup available in the editing environment.</p>
	  <p>We prefer collaboration tools that utilize standard menu organization and typical keyboard commands now well known to users from the stand-alone desktop environment. Standard controls require far less learning from the user, whereas specific accessibility modes with custom keyboard commands, and with menus that shift their location on screen pose significantly steep learning challenges to most users with disabilities, not just users with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
          <p>Collaboration tools that support editing of graphics, mathematical notation, or other content types are also within the scope of this document. However, only the collaboration-related aspects of such systems are addressed here. The accessibility issues arising from creating and editing these types of content are not considered, as they are separate problems from the user needs associated with the collaborative features of the tools.</p>
	  <p>Nevertheless it is important that collaborative tools support the full range of editing functions associated with making web content accessible. Among others this would include the ability to add
	  headings, provide alternative text for images and add captions to videos.</p>

        <h3>Scope and Applicability of this Document</h3>
        <p>Accessibility-related guidance provided in this document is applicable to a wide variety of tools. No unnecessary restriction is placed on the types of Web-based software to which it may reasonably be applied.</p>
        <p>If a tool implements one or more of the distinctive features described in section <a href="#distinctive-features"></a>, then the guidance in this document which addresses each such supported feature is relevant and applicable to the tool. Thus, the scope of the document includes any tool implemented using Web technologies that implements at least one of the distinctive features for which guidance is offered in the sections that follow.</p>
        <p>For example, an annotation tool supporting the association of shared comments with selected text in Web pages would offer only a single feature described in this document. For this reason, only section <a href="annotations"></a> would be relevant to the tool.</p>
      </section>
            <section>
		            <h3>Collaboration tools and accessibility</h3>
	<p>By following established guidance, notably that of <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</cite> [[wcag22]], designers of collaboration tools can help ensure that their user interfaces are <em>perceivable</em> to and <em>operable</em> by a wide range of users with disabilities. Following the Guidelines also enables user interfaces to be more <em>understandable</em>, and to be <em>robust</em> in their support for a range of user agents and assistive technologies. In addition, non-normative guidance of a general nature on improving accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities has been published in [[coga-usable]]. However, implementing current guidelines and suggested practices is not sufficient by itself to ensure that the user interface of a collaboration tool can be understood and used efficiently by people with disabilities. Thus, conforming to WCAG may well be insufficient for collaborative environments. For example WCAG does not inform automated interface simplification &mdash; a general web accessibility requirement being considered in APA&apos;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/adapt/">WAI-Adapt Task Force</a>.</p>
        <p>The collaboration features of these tools are necessarily complex. This can impose significant cognitive demands on many users, not only users with specialized accessibility requirements. This is especially true  for users of screen readers, screen magnification and color contrast assistive technologies, as well as for persons living with various cognitive and learning disabilities. Many users cannot track updates on multiple locations simultaneously, Rather, they must view and comprehend the interactive elements of the application&apos;s features  sequentially, for example in speech or braille for screen reader users. A screen reader or magnifier used in a collaborative application may well present suggested changes and comments in one section of the screen while the user is reading a document in a word processor. The user may also be expected to be communicating verbally with fellow collaborators (e.g., in a meeting) while undertaking editing tasks. Moreover, at any time, incoming changes made by collaborators may alter the text that the user is reading or editing in real time.</p>
        <p>Due to the cognitive demands created by collaboration tools in the practical and social contexts in which they are used, strategies for improving accessibility are desirable that extend beyond current W3C guidance.</p>
	<p>Thus when we talk about collaborative tools we necessarily must consider accessibility burdens imposed by their
	concomitant complexity. In truth collaborative tools are necessarily complex interfaces for all users, and not only persons with various disabilities. A fairly common example is the use of arbitrary color to flag edits put forth by different collaborators. However, identifying collaborators only by colorization  violates WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 1.4.1 as described below in <a href="#version-control-changes">User Need 11</a>.</p>

      <h2>User need definition</h2>
      <p>Specific user needs are frequently defined both by   task required to achieve a particular goal and also by environmental conditions. Context matters. For example, the cognitive demands imposed by interacting with the collaboration-related features of an application depend not only on the needs and capabilities of the user, including the possible presence of assistive technology, but also on the context. A collaborative task that the user can perform independently while working alone in a distraction-free environment may become cognitively burdensome if performed in a situation such as a meeting. Working with comments and suggested changes in a document may become more cognitively demanding if other authors are simultaneously editing the same content, and the user needs to be aware of their activities (e.g., to avoid introducing conflicting changes) while still performing the editing task. The use of different input types and methods, such as speech input or switch-based input, can affect the amount of time required to enter and edit text, as well as the user's ability to respond to potentially disruptive changes introduced by collaborators.'</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Real-Time co-editing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 1:</strong> Users need to be able to discover the presence of collaborators who are reading or editing the content.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 1:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which <em>status messages</em> alert the user whenever a collaborator opens or closes an interactive session involving the same content that the user is accessing (e.g., the same document).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">WCAG requires that status messages be made available to assistive technologies. See <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</cite> [[wcag22]], success criterion 4.1.3, and the associated definition of <em>status message</em>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 2:</strong> An assistive technology user needs to be informed in real time of changes to the content being made by collaborators.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 2:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which status messages inform the assistive technology user of insertions, deletions or formatting-related changes made by collaborators as they occur.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 3:</strong> Assistive technology users need the ability to read or edit without being distracted by status messages.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 3:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which status messages informing the user of the presence or activities of collaborators are suppressed. This may be achieved by allowing the user selectively to enable and disable specific types of status message, or all such messages.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 4:</strong> An assistive technology user needs the ability to track changes introduced by a specific collaborator as they are made.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 4:</strong> Provide a function that moves and tracks user^apos;s
        focus to the location where a specific collaborator
        is editing. If there are multiple active collaborators, then multiple
        such commands, or a menu of active content editors, should be available.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 5:</strong> Users with vision, cognitive or
        physical disabilities need to be able to edit content without
        distraction from changes introduced by collaborators.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 5:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which changes made by collaborators are not displayed while the user is editing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="annotations">
      <h2>Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 6:</strong> An assistive technology user needs to be informed of the presence of annotations along with the specific part of the content being annotated, such as words, sentences or paragraphs. This also applies to lines of code in a software development project.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 6:</strong> Ensure that information about annotations is conveyed to assistive technologies, together with the boundaries of the text to which the annotation applies, along with any metadata associated with the annotation, and any comment text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">See <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</cite> [[wcag22]], success criterion 1.3.1.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 7:</strong> Assistive technology users need to be able to read text without being distracted by information about annotations.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 7:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which information about annotations is suppressed. This mode might be activated by an application setting, such as a toggle switch controlling the presence or absence of annotations.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 8:</strong> An assistive technology user needs to be able to navigate between annotations (from previous to next) and to obtain a navigable list of annotations (e.g., a list of comments in a word processor document or on a Web page), in order to read and respond to annotations efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 8:</strong> Provide navigation functions and a means of obtaining a list of all the annotations associated with the content.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 9:</strong> Assistive technology users need to be able to control the amount of information presented about annotations to prevent becoming overwhelmed while they are reading, navigating and editing content.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 9:</strong> Provide options for the user to limit the amount of detail presented as each annotation is encountered. For example, it should be possible to suppress presentation of metadata, or replies to comments, or to alert the user only to the presence of the annotation without presenting the metadata or comment text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">REQ 8 may be valuable to users in general, and it should be considered for inclusion as a feature of collaboration tools themselves.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Version control features</h2>
      <section id="version-control-changes">
        <h3>Suggested changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User Need 10:</strong> Assistive technology users need to be able to read the text with information included about <em>suggested changes</em> (i.e., insertions, deletions or formatting modifications proposed by collaborators).</li>
          <li><strong>REQ 10:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which
          details of insertions, deletions and formatting changes are appropriately presented
          by the assistive technology as the user reads the content.</li>
          <li><strong>User Need 11:</strong> Users with color blindness need to be able to distinguish insertions, deletions, and unaltered text effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>REQ 11:</strong> Use distinctions other than color to identify inserted and deleted text in the visual interface as required by WCAG 2.2 <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color">Success Criterion 1.4.1: Use of Color</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Presenting Differences Between Revisions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User Need 12:</strong> Users need to be able to compare revisions in meaningful units (words, sentences, lines, etc.), according to the nature of the content, to maximize comprehension.</li>
          <li><strong>REQ 12:</strong> Present differences in a manner that is appropriate to the type of content. For example, software source code might be presented with line-by-line differences, whereas natural language documents might be presented with differences shown word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Notifications and Messages</h2>
      <p>Collaboration tools may send notifications to the user for a variety of reasons. For example, a user may be notified if a collaborator asynchronously submits changes to a document or project, or adds a comment. These notifications may be delivered via operating system facilities, or by a messaging service, such as e-mail or an instant message protocol. Moreover, the collaboration tool may support commenting, issue tracking, or other forms of interaction via external messaging. These optional capabilities are addressed in the following user needs and system requirements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 13:</strong> Users who are easily distracted need to receive only notifications that are crucially important to their collaborative activity.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 13:</strong> Ensure that users can choose which types of notification are delivered, and which are suppressed, according to the nature of the information conveyed.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 14:</strong> Users for whom reading text is slow or difficult need information that is important to the task at hand to be clearly distinguished and prioritized.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 14A:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which notifications are short, and links to more detailed information are included. In this mode, full details are not provided in the notification. For example, a user could be notified that a comment or issue has been created,  with the full text being available only via a link rather than as part of the notificational message itself.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 14B:</strong> If e-mail or a similar medium is used to deliver notifications, ensure that the <em>subject</em> of the message clearly specifies the project, document or issue relevant to the notification.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 14C:</strong> If multiple notifications are provided together (e.g., in a single message), ensure that the user can sort the notifications according to reasonable preferences, for example, most recent first, or oldest first. This is applicable, for example, to a series of comments organized as <q>threads</q> of discussion, all delivered in a single summary message to the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Access Controls</h2>
      <p>A collaborative environment may provide access controls to restrict the modification of content to specified individuals or groups of users. Moreover, access controls may be applied to the entire content, as in a document which is marked as <em>read-only</em> in a text editor or office application, or they may restrict editing to designated parts. Depending on the capabilities of the application, permissions may be changed by an authorized user during a collaborative editing session.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>User Need 15:</em> Users of assistive technologies and those with cognitive or learning disabilities need to be able to find out whether they have permission to edit content, in whole or in part.</li>
        <li><em>REQ 15:</em> Ensure that the applicable permission (e.g., read-only state) affecting content currently in focus is prominently presented in the user interface, and that it is made available to assistive technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><em>User Need 16:</em> Users, including those with learning or cognitive disabilities and those with assistive technologies, need to be informed of changes made to access permissions that take effect during an editing session.</li>
        <li><em>REQ 16:</em> If an access control affecting the content currently in focus is changed during an editing session, for example by a collaborator, a notification of the change is presented in the user interface, and made available to assistive technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note"><cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</cite> [[wcag22]] should be consulted for guidance on ensuring that the user interface for configuring access controls meets appropriate accessibility requirements.</p>
